# My-Small-Projects
I collected all of my small projects, which are the code in my class or the topic I found interesting on Kaggle, in this Repository.
I hope to use this repository to record what I have learnt or tried in my data analytics learning.
## [Kobe Bryant's Scoring Analysis](https://github.com/Zion-Zhou/My-Small-Projects/tree/master/Kobe%20Bryant's%20Scoring%20Analysis)
In this project, I analysed kobe's scoring information. For example, it's shooting position with frequency as density. Also, there are some records that didn't labeled(no record of scoring or not), so we can use Random Forest Classifier to predict the scoring probability. In the Random Forest Classifier, I used grid search method to choose the best coefficients of parameters.
